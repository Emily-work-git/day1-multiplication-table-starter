### OIDC Report - Emily ###

#### 1. Objective - What Did We Learn Today?
   We explored how to utilize a context map to clarify requirements, discussed naming principles and suggestions for Git commits, and reviewed the structure and purpose of standup meetings.

#### 2. My Feelings
   I found the context map to be quite inspiring.

#### 3. Why?
   The context map serves as an effective tool for facilitating programming tasks, addressing the common challenge of unclear requirements that can make it difficult to grasp task expectations and assess our progress. By breaking tasks into smaller, verifiable components, we can better understand the necessary actions to complete them, which helps prevent feelings of being lost during implementation and fosters a sense of accomplishment. I think this approach is particularly beneficial for development-related tasks, ensuring we donâ€™t overlook any requirements and potentially enhancing our code structure. However, I wonder if this method can be applied to higher-level design tasks, especially when dealing with abstract and unmeasurable requirements, such as user acceptance and satisfaction.

#### 4. Action Points: What Changes Will I Make?
   I plan to adopt this strategy for my upcoming development tasks to improve clarity and efficiency. Specifically, I will create context maps for each new task, ensuring they are updated regularly. I will also implement consistent naming conventions and propose a structured format for standup meetings to enhance communication.
